This is the README for Libredis (http://github.com/toymachine/libredis)

Libredis is a C based general client library for Redis.

A PHP extension is also included based on the lower-level C library.

The goal of Libredis is to provide efficient low-level plumbing for accessing Redis servers. 

It should be easy to build higher level abstractions on top of Libredis 
(of which the included PHP extension is an example).

Libredis provides a fast and efficient IO implementation for talking concurrently 
with multiple Redis servers (using libevent based non-blocking IO). It uses a 'batch' abstraction in order
to support pipeline-ing (e.g. send more than 1 command to Redis in a single operation).
And finally a consistent hashing implementation (Ketama) is provided for partitioning keys across servers.

-- Hello world (in PHP, using the included php extension) --

$libredis = Libredis();
$connection = $libredis->get_connection("127.0.0.1");
//set a key
$batch = $libredis->create_batch();
$batch->set('hello', 'world');
$batch->execute($connection); 
//now fetch the key
$batch = $libredis->create_batch();
$batch->get('hello');
$batch->execute($connection);
while($batch->next_reply(&$reply_type, &$reply_value, &$reply_length)) {
    echo $reply_value, PHP_EOL;    
}

-- Talking to multiple servers in parallel --

$libredis = Libredis();
$connection1 = $libredis->get_connection("127.0.0.1:6973");
$connection2 = $libredis->get_connection("127.0.0.1:6980");
$batch1 = $libredis->create_batch();
$batch1->set('hello', 'world');
$batch2 = $libredis->create_batch();
$batch2->set('hello2', 'world2');
$executor = $libredis->create_executor();
$executor->add($connection1, $batch1); //associate connection1 with batch1
$executor->add($connection2, $batch2); //associate connection1 with batch1
$executor->execute(); // execute all batches against their corresponding connections in parallel.
